# SW2 Final Group Project: Revision App

## Task

The self-assigned brief agreed on by the team for this final-week group project is to create an application which can help people to revise information that they are trying to learn.  This could be useful for school children, university students, adult learners, autodidacts... or CodeClan students.

#### MVP

The _**Minimum**_ Viable Product is very minimal indeed: simply to build a digital equivalent of an old-fashioned stack of flashcards, with the question and answer pairs stored in the back-end Mongo database. Only one revision topic is required for MVP, and it should be coding.

To help facilitate the extensions, the MVP should also include a home/welcome/info page, and a means of navigating between it and the flashcards which will scale to accommodate other options.

#### Extensions

While the MVP for this project is extremely basic, it is also hugely extensible.  Possible extensions (some more easily achievable than others) are listed below, in no particular order:

* Present the flashcard learning material from the db in different ways, such as:
  * A 'pairs' game
  * Matching up multiple questions and answers
* Store learning material in other formats, which can be presented in different ways, such as:
  * Parson's Problems
  * A simple way of keeping basic study notes
  * Multiple choice Q&A's
  * Pictorially-based Q&A's
* Allow more than one topic for learning, with separate banks of Q&A for each, and a way of switching between, e.g. coding, Spanish language, dates from history, world capitals, etc., etc.
* Add a facility for users to mark question, which would enable...
* Include some form of score keeping / progress reporting
* Add spaced repetition for flashcards
* Provide a facility for users to create their own questions and answers, thus allowing:
  * Base sets of questions on a given topic
  * Personalised sets of questions
  * And ultimately, sharing of question sets between users
* Let users mark questions as 'learned', such that they no longer appear in their tests

## Considerations

Other extensions may be considered
